## 🧩 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Focus Wallet – Smart RFID Financial Discipline Device
Hardware-software hybrid system designed to create physical friction for impulse spending.

- RFID card detection
- Embedded state machine logic
- Budget-triggered lock mechanisms
- Haptic feedback integration
- Mobile-app companion architecture (in development)

> Goal: Merge behavioral psychology with embedded systems design.

### 🔹 PLC Automation Projects
Industrial-style ladder logic systems including:

- Motor control sequencing
- Fault detection logic
- Interlock systems
- HMI signal mapping
- Structured I/O documentation

---

### 🔹 Robotics Control Experiments
- PID motor control
- Sensor filtering
- State-based robot behaviors
- Linux-based embedded C++ builds

## 🏗️ Engineering Philosophy

I believe engineering should:

- Solve real human problems  
- Be physically testable  
- Be iteration-driven  
- Integrate mechanical + electrical + software thinking  

I document systems clearly because good engineering scales.
